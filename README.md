In this report we explore the multiple dynamics of ROS by setting the task to pick up an object with the PhantomX Pincher.  Our plan is simple, we travel through Arduino and MoveIt! , promising programs that will allow us to control the arm through ROS.  Synonymously we will manipulate the Turtlebot to move through our created map from Lidar by setting manual goals, and we troubleshoot and find paths to complete our objective.  Ultimately we will notate in this report where we finished.
